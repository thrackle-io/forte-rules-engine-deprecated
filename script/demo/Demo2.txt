LIVE DEMO
1. Brief overview of Architecture
2. Explain Action Based Rules
3. Discuss setup steps for the demo

## Additional useful info:
1. Command to run the demo setup script
    sh script/demo/DemoSetup.sh
2. Commands to stop the server:
    ps aux | grep anvil
    kill ????
3. Users and permissions:
    APP_ADMIN_1=Application Administrator, Rule Bypass Admin
    BOB=On the approved list
    ALICE=standard user
    CAROL=standard user


## Transfer from Dev(Rule Bypass Admin) to ALICE. ALICE has no extra permissions. This user may not transfer the token anywhere except to a Dev account
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $ALICE 10 --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1

## check ALICE's Token Balance
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $ALICE --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1 

## Attempt to Transfer from ALICE to BOB, a privileged user. This will fail
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $CAROL 1 --private-key $ALICE_KEY --from $ALICE

## check ALICE's Token Balance
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $ALICE --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1 

## Add ALICE to the privileged list
cast send $ORACLE_1_HANDLER "addAddressToApprovedList(address)" $ALICE --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL

## Now ALICE is allowed to Transfer to BOB, another approved user.
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $BOB 1 --private-key $ALICE_KEY --from $ALICE

## check ALICE's Token Balance
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $ALICE --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1
