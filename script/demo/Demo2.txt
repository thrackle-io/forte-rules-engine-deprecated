LIVE DEMO
1. Brief overview of Architecture
2. Explain Action Based Rules
3. Discuss setup steps for the demo

## Additional useful info:
1. Command to run the demo setup script
    sh script/demo/DemoSetup.sh
2. Commands to stop the server:
    ps aux | grep anvil
    killall anvil
3. Users and permissions:
    APP_ADMIN_1=Application Administrator, Rule Bypass Admin
    BOB=On the approved list
    ALICE=standard user
    CAROL=standard user


## Transfer from Dev(Rule Bypass Admin) to BOB. BOB is on the "highly engaged list" but he may not transfer the token to any users not on the "highly engaged list" except for a Dev account
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $BOB 10 --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1

## check BOB's Token Balance
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $BOB --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1 

## Attempt to Transfer from BOB to CAROL, a user not on the "highly engaged list". This will fail because CAROL is not on the "highly engaged list"
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $CAROL 1 --private-key $BOB_KEY --from $BOB

## check CAROL's Token Balance to make sure it failed
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $CAROL --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1 

## Add CAROL to the "highly engaged list"
cast send $ORACLE_1_HANDLER "addAddressToApprovedList(address)" $CAROL --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL

## Now BOB is allowed to Transfer to CAROL.
cast send $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "transfer(address,uint256)" $CAROL 1 --private-key $BOB_KEY --from $BOB

## check CAROL's Token Balance
cast call $APPLICATION_ERC20_1 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" $CAROL --private-key $APP_ADMIN_1_KEY --from $APP_ADMIN_1
