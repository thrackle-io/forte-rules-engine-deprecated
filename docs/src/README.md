# Rules Protocol

[![Project Version][version-image]][version-url]

This repository contains an EVM-based protocol designed to meet the unique needs of games with tokenized assets and on-chain economies. The protocol enables the creation and management of economic and compliance controls for your gameâ€™s economy at the token level, allowing for maximum flexibility while maintaining the transparency and trustlessness of Web3.

# @thrackle-io/rules-protocol-client

## Description

This package contains everything necessary for developers to launch their own application which will be compatible with the Rules Protocol.

## Installation

To install the package simply go to the root of your project in the terminal, and do:

```c
npm i @thrackle-io/rules-protocol-client
```

That's it!

## Dependencies

This package requires `@openzeppelin/contracts` version 4.9 and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` version 4.9.

If the contracts show any compiling errors, try to manually update the version of the existing openzeppelin library in your project by doing:

```c
npm i @openzeppelin/contracts@=4.9
```

and

```c
npm i @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable@=4.9
```

## Usage

To use the package simply import the files you are interested in. Here is an example on how to create a Rules-Protocol compatible ERC20:

```c
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "@thrackle-io/rules-protocol-client/token/ERC20/ProtocolERC20.sol";

/**
 * @title Example ERC20 ApplicationERC20
 * @author @ShaneDuncan602, @oscarsernarosero, @TJ-Everett
 * @notice This is an example implementation that App Devs should use.
 * @dev During deployment _tokenName _tokenSymbol _appManagerAddress _handlerAddress are set in constructor
 */
contract ApplicationERC20 is ProtocolERC20 {
    /**
     * @dev Constructor sets params
     * @param _name Name of the token
     * @param _symbol  Symbol of the token
     * @param _appManagerAddress App Manager address
     */
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _appManagerAddress
    ) ProtocolERC20(_name, _symbol, _appManagerAddress) {}

}
```

As you can see, everything is already encapsulated inside the:

```c
import "@thrackle-io/rules-protocol-client/token/ERC20/ProtocolERC20.sol";
```

All you need to do is to inherit the right contract and implement any necessary function. In this case, the `mint` function.
