[Git Source](https://github.com/thrackle-io/Tron/blob/afc52571532b132ea1dea91ad1d1f1af07381e8a/src/interfaces/IERC165.sol)

*Interface of the ERC165 standard, as defined in the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[EIP].
Implementers can declare support of contract interfaces, which can then be
queried by others ({ERC165Checker}).
For an implementation, see {ERC165}.*


## Functions
### supportsInterface

*Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. See the corresponding
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified[EIP section]
to learn more about how these ids are created.
This function call must use less than 30 000 gas.*
