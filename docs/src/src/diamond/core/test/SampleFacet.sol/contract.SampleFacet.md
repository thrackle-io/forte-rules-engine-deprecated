[Git Source](https://github.com/thrackle-io/rules-protocol/blob/2738cf9716e0fddfad4df13fdb6486b5987af931/src/diamond/core/test/SampleFacet.sol)

**Inherits:**
[ERC173](/src/diamond/implementations/ERC173/ERC173.sol/abstract.ERC173.md)

This contract only exists for testing purposes. It is here to test diamond upgrades. It is named "Sample" instead
of "Test" because naming it "Test" causes problems with Foundry testing.
