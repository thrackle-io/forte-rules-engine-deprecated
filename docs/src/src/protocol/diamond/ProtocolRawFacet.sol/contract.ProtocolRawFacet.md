# ProtocolRawFacet
[Git Source](https://github.com/thrackle-io/forte-rules-engine/blob/c24a67035f9dc2b86d52113e68cb76f2f45fa3f2/src/protocol/diamond/ProtocolRawFacet.sol)

**Inherits:**
ERC165Facet, ERC173Facet

**Author:**

*The code for this comes from Nick Mudge's sample contracts. The only reason this is here is so that the deploy scripts can
still use Foundry's vm.getCode operation to pull the function selectors for the facets.*
