## Rule Processor Diamond Information: 

The Rule Processor Diamond is a proxy contract that is used by application contracts to assess economic actions against rules that are active within that handler. The Rule Processor will delegate those calls to the appropriate facet contract, allowing for efficient on chain rule assessments per transaction. The Rule Processor Diamond proxy also acts as a single source address for the creation of rules for application contracts. [Rule administrators](../../permissions/ADMIN-ROLES.md) of an application are allowed to add rules to the Rule Processor Diamond storage. These rules are immutable once created and can be shared across different applications with the rule id number generated by the protocol.
