# The Protocol
[![Project Version][version-image]][version-url]

> The protocol allows client applications to leverage controls in order to manage their assets and create an economic climate that suits their ecosystem. Transfer restrictions, access-tier-based rules, risk mitigations, and many other functionalities are available.
>
> All the rules are configurable and may be modified to suit the needs of each client. They can be activated/deactivated as needed.
