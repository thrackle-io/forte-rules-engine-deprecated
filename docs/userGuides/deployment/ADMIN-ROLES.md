# APP ADMINISTRATOR ROLES 
[![Project Version][version-image]][version-url]

The super admin account is set during the [deployment][deployAppManager-url] of the AppManager in the constructor. Ensure you use it when creating App Admins. App Admins are used to create all other [admin roles][createAdminRole-url]. 

---

## SUPER ADMIN

### Overview
Super admin is set at construction of the App Manager(the deploying address of the AppManager). This role is the highest in the hierarchy of roles and can grant/revoke the app admin role. Functions with the modifier onlyRole(SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE) can only be called by this role. **There can only be one super admin in an application**, and the only way to grant another account the super-admin role is by using the function `proposeNewSuperAdmin` in which case current super admin would effectively renounce the super admin role and all of its privilages to grant it to the new address. The new address has to confirm the acceptance of the super-admin role for the process to take effect, otherwise the old super admin will remain in the role.

### Proposed Super Admin
There is a transitionary role called "proposed super Admin". There can only be one address member of this role, and it can only be added by the super admin role when invoking `proposeNewSuperAdmin`. Once the proposed account confirms the role by invoking `confirmSuperAdmin`, the new super Admin will renounce to the proposed-super-Admin role. 

### Capabilities
* The Super Administrator is the initial approver/creator of the application ecosystem.

* The Super Administrator may approve/add subsequent Application Administrators.
* The Super Administrator may NOT renounce itâ€™s role except via the Proposed Super Admin process described above. There must be at least one Super Administrator at all times.

### Role Hash
Roles can be identified by their Keccak256 hash in the logs.
