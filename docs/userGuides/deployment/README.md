# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy into your selected EVM blockchain everything you need for the protocol. From the protocol processor to the application tokens, this guide will lead you step by step in the deployment process. This guide is broken down into modules to make it easier to follow, and is listed in the same logical order that they must be deployed in order to succeed:

1. Deploy the protocol if it doesn't exist yet. Go to [Deploy Protocol](DEPLOY-PROTOCOL.md).
2. Then, deploy your Application Manager. Go to [Deploy Appmanager](DEPLOY-APPMANAGER.md).
3. Setup the pricing module for your application. Go to [Deply Pricing](DEPLOY-PRICING.md).
4. Now you can start deploying your application tokens. Go to [NFT Deployment](NFT-DEPLOYMENT.md).
5. Once you have your application and your tokens deployed, you can start creating and applying rules to your application and tokens. Go to [Create App Rules](CREATE-APP-RULES.md) and [Create NFT Rules](CREATE-NFT-RULES.md).

Your application is ready to roll!
