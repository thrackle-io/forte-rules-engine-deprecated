# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy to the blockchain everything you need from the protocol processor to the application tokens. The deployment must follow a logic order in order to succeed:

1. Deploy the protocol if it doesn't exist yet. Go to [Deploy Protocol](DEPLOY-PROTOCOL.md).
2. Then, deploy your Application Manager. Go to [Deploy Appmanager](DEPLOY-APPMANAGER.md).
3. Setup the pricing module for your application. Go to [Deply Pricing](DEPLOY-PRICING.md).
4. Now you can start deploying your application tokens. Go to [NFT Deployment](NFT-DEPLOYMENT.md).
5. Once you have your application and your tokens deployed, you can start creating and applying rules to your application and tokens. Go to [Create App Rules](CREATE-APP-RULES.md) and [Create NFT Rules](CREATE-NFT-RULES.md).
