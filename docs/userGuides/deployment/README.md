# Deployment Guide

This is a step-by-step guide to protocol and protocol supported application deployments. This guide is broken down into modules to make it easier to follow and is listed in the proper deployment order:

1. Deploy the protocol if it doesn't exist yet. Go to [Deploy Protocol](DEPLOY-PROTOCOL.md).
2. Then, deploy your Application Manager. Go to [Deploy Appmanager](DEPLOY-APPMANAGER.md).
3. Optionally, setup the pricing module for your application. Go to [Deploy Pricing](DEPLOY-PRICING.md).
4. Now you can start deploying your application tokens. Go to [Deploy Tokens and Token Handlers](./DEPLOY-TOKENS-AND-TOKEN-HANDLERS.md).
5. Once you have your application and your tokens deployed, you can start creating and applying rules to your application and tokens. Go to [Create App Rules](CREATE-APP-RULES.md) and [Create NFT Rules](CREATE-NFT-RULES.md).
6. (Optional) To see what's available in deployment of the scripts, see [Deployment scripts index](./DEPLOYMENT-SCRIPTS.md).

Your application is ready to roll!
