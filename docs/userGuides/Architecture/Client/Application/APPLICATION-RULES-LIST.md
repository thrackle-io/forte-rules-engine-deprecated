# Application Level Rules
[![Project Version][version-image]][version-url]

---

| Application Level Rules | Purpose |
|:-|:-|
| [Account Deny For No Access Level](./ACCOUNT-DENY-FOR-NO-ACCESS-LEVEL.md) | The purpose of this rule is to provide a way to prevent the transfer of assets for accounts that do not have an access level or whose access level has been set to 0. For example, the application may decide users may not accumulate or transfer any assets without first performing specific onboarding activities. The application developer may set the account deny for no access level rule to active. As accounts are introduced to the ecosystem, they may not receive any assets until the application changes their access level to a higher value. |
| [Account Max Tx Value By Risk Rule](./ACCOUNT-MAX-TX-VALUE-BY-RISK-SCORE.md) | The purpose of this rule is to prevent accounts identified as "risky" from moving large amounts of US Dollars in tokens within a specified period of time. This attempts to mitigate the existential, ethical or legal risks to an economy posed by such accounts. |
| [Account Max Value By Access Level Rule](./ACCOUNT-MAX-VALUE-BY-ACCESS-LEVEL.md) | The purpose of this rule is to provide balance limits for accounts at the application level based on an application defined segment of users. The segments are defined as the access levels of the accounts. This rule may be used to provided gated accumulation of assets to ensure accounts cannot accumulate more assets without performing other actions defined by the application. For example, the application may decide users may not accumulate any assets without performing specific onboarding activities. The application developer may set a maximum balance of $0 for the default access level and $1000 for the next access level. As accounts are introduced to the ecosystem, they may not receive any assets until the application changes their access level to a higher value. |
| [Account Max Value By Risk](./ACCOUNT-MAX-VALUE-BY-RISK.md) | The account-max-value-by-risk-score rule enforces accumulated balance limits in U.S. dollars for user accounts based on a protocol assigned risk score to that account via the application manager. Risk scores are ranged between 0-99. Balance limits are set by range based on the risk scores given at rule creation. For example, if risk scores given in the array are: 25,50,75 and balance limits are: 500,250,100. The balance limit ranges are as follows: 0-24 = NO LIMIT, 25-49 = 500, 50-74 = 250, 75-99 = 100.  |
| [Account Max Value Out By Access Level](./ACCOUNT-MAX-VALUE-OUT-BY-ACCESS-LEVEL.md) | The purpose of this rule is to provide limits on the amount of funds that an account can remove from the application's economy based on an application defined segment of users. The segments are defined as the access levels of the accounts. This rule may be used to provide gated withdrawal limits of assets to ensure accounts cannot withdraw more US Dollars or chain native tokens without first performing other actions defined by the application. For example, the application may decide users may not withdraw without performing specific onboarding activities. The application developer may set the most restrictive withdraw limit of $0 for the default access level and $1000 for the next access level. As accounts are introduced to the ecosystem, they may not withdraw from the ecosystem until the application changes their access level to a higher value. This rule does not prevent the accumulation of protocol supported assets. |
| [Pause Rule](./PAUSE-RULE.md) | The purpose of the pause rule is to allow developers to pause the entirety of an application for maintenance, security or any other reason. Pausing the application means that no transfer of tokens is allowed at any level (with the few exceptions listed in the Role Applicability section).  |

###### **Application Level Rules are set in the [App Handler](./APP-HANDLER.md) by a [Rule Administrator](../../../permissions/ADMIN-ROLES.md)**
