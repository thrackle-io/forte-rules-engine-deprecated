# ACCESS LEVELS CONTRACTS

## Purpose

The purpose of access levels is provide a tiered approach to user verification and/or categorization that can be used in conjunction with access level rules. Access levels may be defined using built-in protocol functionality or an external provider:

- [Protocol Access Level](./PROTOCOL-ACCESS-LEVEL-STRUCTURE.md).
- [External Access Level](./EXTERNAL-ACCESS-LEVEL-PROVIDER.md).

Access levels are used with the following rules:

- [Maximum Account Balance By Access Level Rule](../rules/MAX-BALANCE-BY-ACCESS-LEVEL.md).
- [Withdrawal Limit By Access Level](../rules/WITHDRAWAL-LIMIT-BY-ACCESS-LEVEL.md).
- [Account Deny For No Access Level](./TBD.md).
