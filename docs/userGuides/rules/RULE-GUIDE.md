| Rule                                           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Minimum Account Balance By Date                | Similar to the Minimum Account Balance rule, this rule allows an application developer to set a minimum balance an account must hold for a specified amount of time. This is an enhanced control that can be set and forgotten for a specific set of accounts as opposed to the entire token ecosystem. The balance, specified as a token quantity, must be kept until the specified date/time is reached.             |
| Minimum/Maximum Account Balances               | Application developers may wish to enable specific minimum and maximum account balances associated with specifically tagged accounts. These tags may be set by the application admin accounts according to their experience or rating within the application. This means the tagged accounts must remain within the set minimum and maximum account balances when transactions are attempted.                          |
| Transaction Restriction By Access Level        | Transaction limits for each of the designated Access Level 1 through Access Level 4 may be set by the corresponding application admin accounts via transactions. These values represent the total token value that an account may hold in USDC. Access Level 0 may not transact at all.                                                                                                                                |
| Transaction Size Limits by Risk                | Based on the risk score, an application developer may wish to enable transaction size limitations on specific accounts of interest designated by their high risk score in their token economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Withdrawal rule                                | In some instances, an application developer may wish to ensure a specific subset of participants in the token economy cannot withdraw a large amount of value from the economy until a specified date. For instance, an application developer may wish to promise on-chain that they will not withdraw more than X GC worth of value from the system until one year after the launch of their token.                   |
| Oracle                                         | Application developers may wish to make use of oracles for “approved-list” and “denied-list” checking to ensure compliance with external sanction lists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Transfer Counter                               | NFT’s are transferable but application developers may wish to impose transfer restrictions to reduce volatility and malfeasance over a fixed time period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Token Percentage                               | The Token Purchase rule allows an application developer to enable a maximum purchase percentage for their token within a specified time range. This mechanism may be desired if the application developer does not want all of their token supply to be purchased in a small amount of time.                                                                                                                           |
| Account Balance by Risk Score                  | Based on the risk score, an application developer may wish to enable account balance limitations on specific accounts of interest designated by their high risk score in their token economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Account Sell                                   | The Account Sell rule is an account based measure which restricts an account’s ability to sell a token. This may be put in place to restrict large transactions from occurring against suspected malicious accounts or other accounts of interest.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Account Purchase                               | The Account Purchase rule is an account-based measure which restricts an account’s ability to buy more of a token if the account balance exceeds a specified threshold within a specified time period. This value is in token units.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Balance by Access Level                        | Account values for each of the designated Access Level 1 through Access Level 4 may be set by the corresponding application admin accounts via transactions. These values represent the total token value that an account may hold in USDC. Access Level 0 may not transact at all.                                                                                                                                    |
| Application Admin Withdrawal                          | In some instances, an application developer may wish to assure users they will not pillage the ecosystem and then abandon it. For instance, an application developer may wish to promise on-chain that they will not withdraw more than 1000 tokens worth of value from the system until users have collectively withdrawn more than 100,000 tokens. NOTE: This rule is dependent upon trust of the "Super Admin" account as this account has permissions to remove the "App Admin" role thus allowing an admin to be released from the rule restriction.                                                                  |
| Transaction Size Per Time Period by Risk Score | Similar to the Transaction Size rule, based on the risk score, an application developer may wish to enable transaction size limitations on specific accounts of interest designated by their high risk score in their token economy on a fixed time period.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Circulating Supply Volatility                  | If the application developer were to create an inflationary/deflationary supply token economy, they may wish to enable a control to ensure the token supply does not change by more than a specified percentage in a fixed time period.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Minimum Transaction                            | Some application developers may wish to impose a minimum transaction amount for a transaction to be successful. This may allow application developers to ensure users are not spamming the ecosystem with micro-transfers set by requiring a minimum number of tokens be involved in transactions.   
| Minimum Hold Time                            | Some application developers may wish to impose a minimum hold time for each of their assets. This allows for that possibility.                                                                     |
| Token Percentage Purchase                      | The Token Purchase rule allows an application developer to enable a maximum purchase percentage for their token within a specified time range. This mechanism may be desired if the application developer does not want all of their token supply to be purchased in a small amount of time.                                                                                                                           |
| Token Percentage Sell                          | The Token Sell rule mimics the Token Percentage Purchase rule but allows an application developer to enable a maximum sell percentage within a specified time range.  This mechanism may be desired if the application developer does not want all of their tokens to be liquidated in a short period of time.                                                                                                         |
| Token Trading Volume                           | To reduce high volatility periods, an application developer may choose to enable a trading volume limitation within a specified time period. The Token Trading Volume control allows the application developer to specify a trading volume percentage. When the total trading volume reaches this percentage of the total token supply, trading is suspended for a specified time period.                              |
| Token Volatility                               | To slow and limit high volatility, an application developer may wish to enable a Token Volatility rule which tracks the token prices over a specified number of blocks and shuts down transactions for some period of time when the price has changed by some percentage of the original price.                                                                                                                        |
| Token Purchase Fee by Volume                   | The Token Purchase Fee By Volume rule allows an application developer to increase token purchase fees based on the total number of tokens sold during a 24 hour period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Pause Window                                   | At times, it may be necessary to disable transactions on a particular token while maintenance functions or other activities are performed on a supporting application such as an application server or dashboard. A maintenance window can be designated by application admin accounts to suspend all application token activity during a specified time period. This would suspend all transactions for a given time period. Adding a pause rule in the appManager will activate the pauseRule check in the appHandler. Removing all pause rules will also deactivate pause rule checks in the appHandler. Pause rule checks can be enabled or disabled at anytime by rule admins via the appManager. This increases gas efficiency on transactions. Enable/diable can be done without the removal or pause window being complete. |
