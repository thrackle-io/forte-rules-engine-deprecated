| Rule | Purpose |
|:-|:-| 
| [Account Balance by Risk Rule](./ACCOUNT-BALANCE-BY-RISK.md) | The account-balance-by-risk rule enforces accumulated balance limits in U.S. dollars for user accounts based on a protocol assigned risk score to that account via the application manager. Risk scores are ranged between 0-99. Balance limits are set by range based on the risk scores given at rule creation. For example, if risk scores given in the array are: 25,50,75 and balance limits are: 500,250,100. The balance limit ranges are as follows: 0-24 = NO LIMIT, 25-49 = 500, 50-74 = 250, 75-99 = 100. |  
| [Admin Withdrawal Rule](./ADMIN-WITHDRAWAL-RULE.md) | The purpose of the admin-withdrawal rule is to allow developers to prove to their community that they will hold a certain amount of tokens for a certain period of time. Adding this rule prevents developers from flooding the market with their supply and effectively "rug pulling" their community. |
| [Maximum Account Balance By Access Level Rule](./MAX-BALANCE-BY-ACCESS-LEVEL.md) | The purpose of this rule is to provide balance limits for accounts at the application level based on an application defined segment of users. The segments are defined as the access levels of the accounts. This rule may be used to provided gated accumulation of assets to ensure accounts cannot accumulate more assets without performing other actions defined by the application. For example, the application may decide users may not accumulate any assets without performing specific onboarding activities. The application developer may set a maximum balance of $0 for the default access level and $1000 for the next access level. As accounts are introduced to the ecosystem, they may not receive any assets until the application changes their access level to a higher value. |
| [Minimum Account Balance By Date Rule](./MINIMUM-ACCOUNT-BALANCE-BY-DATE.md) | The purpose of the minimum-balance-by-date rule is to prevent token holders from rapidly flooding the market with newly acquired tokens since a dramatic increase in supply over a short time frame can cause a token price crash. This rule attempts to mitigate this scenario by making holders wait some period of time before they can transfer their tokens. The length of time depends on the account's tags. Different accounts may need to wait different periods of time depending on their tags, or even no time at all. |
| [Minimum Hold Time](./MINIMUM-HOLD-TIME.md) | The purpose of the minimum-hold-time rule is to reduce trade volitility by preventing transfers of tokens for a number of hours after ownership is acquired, either via minting or transfers. This rule allows developers to specifiy a number of hours, up to 43830 (5 years), that each tokenId must be held for. |
| [Minimum Transaction](./MINIMUM-TRANSACTION.md)| The purpose of the minimum-transaction rule is to prevent micro-trades or dust trades within an ecosystem. A developer can set the minimum number of tokens required per transfer to prevent these types of trades. |
| [Min/Max Account Balance Rule](./MIN-MAX-ACCOUNT-BALANCE.md)] | The minimum-maximum-account-balance rule enforces token balance thresholds for user accounts with specific tags. This allows developers to set lower and upper limits on the amount of each token the user account can hold. This rule attempts to mitigate the risk of token holders selling more than the minimum allowed amount and accumulating more than the maximum allowed amount of tokens for each specific tag. |
| [Oracle](./ALLOW-DENY-ORACLE.md) | The purpose of the allow-deny-oracle rule is to check if the receiver address in the transaction is an allowed or restricted address. Addresses are added to the oracle lists by the owner of the oracle contract for any reason that the owner deems necessary. If an address is not on an allowed oracle list, they will be restricted from receiving application tokens. This rule can be used to restrict transfers to only specific contract addresses or wallets that are approved by the oracle owner. An example is NFT exchanges that support ERC2981 royalty payments. The deny list is designed as a tool to reduce the risk of malicious actors in the ecosystem. If an address is on the deny oracle list they are restricted receiving tokens. Any address not on the deny list will pass this rule check. |
| [Pause Rule](./PAUSE-RULE.md) | The purpose of the pause rule is to allow developers to pause the entirety of an application for maintenance, security or any other reason. Pausing the application means that no transfer of tokens is allowed at any level (with the few exceptions listed in the Role Applicability section).  |
| [Token Transfer Volume Rule](./TOKEN-TRANSFER-VOLUME.md) | The purpose of the token-transfer-volume rule is to reduce high trading volatility periods by allowing developers to set a maximum volume (as a percentage of the token's total supply) that can be traded within a period of time. When the trading volume maximum is reached, transfers are suspended until the next period begins. Trading volume is the accumulated total number of tokens transferred during each period, and reset with each new period by the first transaction of that period.  |
| Token Volatility | TODO |
| [Total Supply Volatility Rule](./SUPPLY-VOLATILITY.md) | The purpose of this rule is to prevent a sudden increase or decrease in the supply of a token. This can help to prevent a sudden crash or spike in the price of a token due to sharp changes in the supply side, which could lead to severe damages to the health of the economy in the long run.  |
| Transaction Restriction By Access Level | TODO |
| T[ransaction Size Limits by Risk](./TRANSACTION-SIZE-BY-RISK-SORE.md) | The purpose of this rule is to prevent accounts identified as "risky" from moving large amounts of US Dollars in tokens in a single transaction. This attempts to mitigate the existential, ethical, or legal risks to an economy posed by such accounts. |
| [Transfer Counter Rule](./TRANSFER-COUNTER.md) | The transfer-counter rule enforces a daily limit on the number of trades for each token within a collection. In the context of this rule, a "trade" is a transfer of a token from one address to another. Example uses of this rule: to mitigate price manipulation of tokens in the collection via the limitation of wash trading or the prevention of malfeasance for holders who transfer a token between addresses repeatedly. When this rule is active and the tradesAllowedPerDay is 0 this rule will act as a pseudo "soulBound" token, preventing all transfers of tokens in the collection.   |
| [Transaction Size Per Time Period by Risk Score](./TX-SIZE-PER-PERIOD-BY-RISK-SCORE.md) | The purpose of this rule is to prevent accounts identified as "risky" from moving large amounts of US Dollars in tokens within a specified period of time. This attempts to mitigate the existential, ethical or legal risks to an economy posed by such accounts. |
