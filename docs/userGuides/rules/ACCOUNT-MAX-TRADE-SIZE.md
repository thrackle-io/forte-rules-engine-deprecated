# Account Max Trade Size

## Purpose

The Account Max Trade Size Rule is an account based measure which restricts an accountâ€™s ability to buy or sell more of a token. This may be put in place to restrict large transactions from occurring against suspected malicious accounts or other accounts of interest. The amount of buys or sells allowed depends on the account's tags. Different accounts may get different buy and sell restrictions depending on their tags.

## Applies To:

- [x] ERC20
- [x] ERC721

## Applies To Actions:

- [ ] MINT
- [ ] BURN
- [x] BUY
- [x] SELL
- [ ] TRANSFER(Peer to Peer)
  
## Scope 

This rule works at the token level. It must be activated and configured for each token in the corresponding token handler.

## Data Structure

As this is a [tag](../GLOSSARY.md)-based rule, you can think of it as a collection of rules, where all "sub-rules" are independent from each other, and where each "sub-rule" is indexed by its tag. An account-max-trade-size "sub-rule" is specified by 2 variables:

- **Max Size** (uint256): The maximum amount of tokens that may be bought or sold during the *period*. 
- **Period** (uint16): The length of each time period for which the rule will apply, in hours.


```c
/// ******** Account Max Trade Size Rules ********
struct AccountMaxTradeSize {
    uint256 maxSize; /// token units
    uint16 period; /// hours        
}
```
###### *see [RuleDataInterfaces](../../../src/protocol/economic/ruleProcessor/RuleDataInterfaces.sol)*

If a single blank `tag` is specified, the rule is applicable to all users.

Additionally, each one of these data structures will be under a tag (bytes32) and the:

tag -> sub-rule.

 ```c
/// ruleIndex => userType => rules
mapping(uint32 => mapping(bytes32 => ITaggedRules.AccountMaxTradeSize)) accountMaxTradeSizeRules;
```

And the starting Timestamp for the rule will be global for all tags:

- **Starting Timestamp** (uint64): The Unix timestamp of the date when the *period* starts counting.
 
```c
mapping(uint32 => uint64) startTimes;///Time the rule is applied
```

###### *see [IRuleStorage](../../../src/protocol/economic/ruleProcessor/IRuleStorage.sol)*

The collection of these tagged sub-rules plus the startTime composes an account-max-trade-size rule.

```c
/// ******** Account Max Trade Size Rules ********
struct AccountMaxTradeSizeS {
    /// ruleIndex => userType => rules
    mapping(uint32 => mapping(bytes32 => ITaggedRules.MaxTradeSize)) accountMaxTradeSizeRules;
    mapping(uint32 => uint64) startTimes;///Time the rule is applied
    uint32 accountMaxTradeSizeIndex; /// increments every time someone adds a rule
}
```

###### *see [IRuleProcessor](../../../src/protocol/economic/IRuleProcessor.sol)*

## Configuration and Enabling/Disabling
- This rule can only be configured in the protocol by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be set in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be activated/deactivated in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be updated in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.


## Rule Evaluation

The rule will be evaluated with the following logic:

1. The handler determines if the rule is active from the supplied action. If not, processing does not continue past this step.
2. The token handler decides if the transfer is a Purchase or a Sell (user perspective). If it is, it continues with the next steps.
3. Rule processing differs for the buy/sell type:
   1. [Buy](./ACTION-TYPES.md#buy) 
      1. For non-custodial style buys:
         1. Check the buyer address's access level is greater than 0.
         2. Check that the seller address's access level is greater than 0.
      2. For custodial style buys:
         1. Check the buyer address's access level is greater than 0. 
   2. [Sell](./ACTION-TYPES.md#sell) 
      1.  For non-custodial style sells:
         1. Check the seller address's access level is greater than 0.
         2. Check that the buyer address's access level is greater than 0.
      2. For custodial style sells:
         1. Check the seller address's access level is greater than 0. 
4. The account is passed to the protocol with all the tags it has registered to its address in the application manager.
5. The processor receives these tags along with the ID of the account-max-trade-size rule set in the token handler for the determined action type. 
6. The processor retrieves the sub-rule associated with each tag.
7. The processor evaluates whether the rule is active based on the `starting timestamp`. If it is not active, the rule aborts the next steps, and returns zero as the accrued cumulative value.
8. The processor evaluates whether the current time is within a new period.
   1. If it is a new period, the processor sets the cumulative buys/sells to the current buy amount.
   2. If it is not a new period, the processor adds the current buy/sell amount to the accrued buy amount for the rule period.
   3. If it's a [Buy](./ACTION-TYPES.md#buy) 
      1. For non-custodial style buys:
         1. Check the cumulative buy amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.
         2. When the [Sell](./ACTION-TYPES.md#sell) action is also active, check the cumulative sell amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.
      2. For custodial style buys:
         1. Check the cumulative buy amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.
   4. If it's a [Sell](./ACTION-TYPES.md#sell) 
      1. For non-custodial style sells:
         1. When the [Buy](./ACTION-TYPES.md#buy) action is also active, Check the cumulative buy amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.
         2. Check the cumulative sell amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.
      2. For custodial style sells:
         1. Check the cumulative sell amount is greater than `maxSize` defined in the rule.  
9.  The processor checks if the cumulative amount is greater than the `maxSize` defined in the rule. If true, the transaction reverts.
10. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for each of the account's tags. In the case where multiple tags apply, the most restrictive is applied.
11. Returns the cumulative amount.

**The list of available actions rules can be applied to can be found at [ACTION_TYPES.md](./ACTION-TYPES.md)**

## Evaluation Exceptions 
This rule doesn't apply when:
- An approved Trading-Rule approved address is in the *to* side of the transaction.
- Treasury account is in the *from* or *to* side of the transaction.


### Revert Message

The rule processor reverts with the following error if the rule check fails: 

```
error TxnInFreezeWindow();
```

The selector for this error is `0xa7fb7b4b`.

## Create Function

Adding an account-max-trade-size rule is done through the function:

```c
function addAccountMaxTradeSize(
        address _appManagerAddr,
        bytes32[] calldata _accountTypes,
        uint256[] calldata _maxSizes,
        uint16[] calldata _periods,
        uint64 _startTime
    ) external ruleAdministratorOnly(_appManagerAddr) returns (uint32);
```
###### *see [TaggedRuleDataFacet](../../../src/protocol/economic/ruleProcessor/TaggedRuleDataFacet.sol)* 

The add function will return the protocol ID of the rule.

### Parameters:

- **_appManagerAddr** (address): The address of the application manager to verify that the caller has Rule administrator privileges.
- **_accountTypes** (bytes32[]): Array of applicable general tags.
- **_maxSizes** (uint192[]): Array of max amounts corresponding to each tag.
- **_period** (uint16[]): Array of periods corresponding to each tag. 
- **_startTime** (uint64): Array of Unix timestamps for the *_period* to start counting that applies to each tag.


### Parameter Optionality:
none

### Parameter Validation:

The following validation will be carried out by the add function in order to ensure that these parameters are valid and make sense:

- All input array lengths must be equal and not empty.
- `_appManagerAddr` Must not be the zero address.
- `_accountTypes` `tag` can either be a single blank tag or a list of non blank `tag`s.
- `_maxSizes` 0 not allowed.
- `_period` 0 not allowed.
- `_startTime` 0 not allowed. Must be a valid timestamp no more than 1 year into the future.
