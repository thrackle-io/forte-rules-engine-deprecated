# Account Purchase Rule

## Purpose

The Account Purchase Rule is an account based measure which restricts an accountâ€™s ability to purchase more of a token. This may be put in place to restrict large transactions from occurring against suspected malicious accounts or other accounts of interest. The amount of purchases allowed depends on the account's tags. Different accounts may get different purchase restrictions depending on their tags.

## Applies To:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] ERC20
- [ ] ERC721
- [x] AMM

## Scope 

This rule works at the AMM level. It must be activated and configured for each desired AMM in the corresponding AMM handler. This rule will not be applied at the token level and will only be checked through the AMM swap function. 

## Data Structure

As this is a [tag](../GLOSSARY.md)-based rule, you can think of it as a collection of rules, where all "sub-rules" are independent from each other, and where each "sub-rule" is indexed by its tag. An account-purchase-controller "sub-rule" is specified by 3 variables:

- **Purchase Amounts** (uint192): The maximum amount of tokens that may be purchased during the *purchase period*. 
- **Purchase Periods** (uint16): The length of each time period for which the rule will apply, in hours.
- **Starting Timestamp** (uint64): The Unix timestamp of the date when the *period* starts counting.

The collection of these tagged sub-rules composes an account-purchase-controller rule.

And the starting Timestamp for the rule will be global for all tags:

- **Starting Timestamp** (uint64): The Unix timestamp of the date when the *period* starts counting.
 
```c

        mapping(uint32 => uint64) startTimes;///Time the rule is applied
```

###### *see [IRuleStorage](../../../src/protocol/economic/ruleProcessor/IRuleStorage.sol)*

The collection of these tagged sub-rules plus the startingTime composes an account-purchase-controller rule.

## Configuration and Enabling/Disabling
- This rule can only be configured in the protocol by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be set in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be activated/deactivated in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.
- This rule can only be updated in the asset handler by a **rule administrator**.


## Rule Evaluation

The rule will be evaluated with the following logic:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. The account is passed to the protocol with all the tags it has registered to its address in the application manager.
2. The processor receives these tags along with the ID of the account-purchase-controller rule set in the token handler. 
3. The processor retrieves the sub-rule associated with each tag.
4. The processor evaluates whether the rule is active based on the `starting timestamp`. If it is not active, the rule aborts the next steps, and returns zero as the accrued cumulative purchases value.
5. The processor evaluates whether the current time is within a new period.
   -If it is a new period, the processor sets the cumulative purchases to the current purchase amount.
   -If it is not a new period, the processor adds the current purchase amount to the accrued purchase amount for the rule period. 
6. The processor checks if the cumulative purchases amount is greater than the `purchase amount` defined in the rule. If true, the transaction reverts.
7. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for each of the account's tags. In the case where multiple tags apply, the most restrictive is applied.
8. Returns the cumulative purchases amount.
=======
1. The token handler decides if the transfer is a Purchase (user perspective). Only if it is, it continues with the next steps.
2. The account is passed to the protocol with all the tags it has registered to its address in the application manager.
3. The processor receives these tags along with the ID of the account-purchase-controller rule set in the token handler. 
4. The processor retrieves the sub-rule associated with each tag.
5. The processor evaluates whether the rule is active based on the `starting timestamp`. If it is not active, the rule aborts the next steps, and returns zero as the accrued cumulative purchases value.
6. The processor evaluates whether the current time is within a new period.
   -If it is a new period, the processor sets the cumulative purchases to the current purchase amount.
   -If it is not a new period, the processor adds the current purchase amount to the accrued purchase amount for the rule period. 
7. The processor checks if the cumulative purchases amount is greater than the `purchase amount` defined in the rule. If true, the transaction reverts.
8. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated for each of the account's tags. In the case where multiple tags apply, the most restrictive is applied.
9. Returns the cumulative purchases amount.

## Evaluation Exceptions 
<<<<<<< HEAD
- In the case of ERC20s, this rule doesn't apply when a **registered treasury** address is in the *to* side of the transaction.
=======
This rule doesn't apply when:
- An approved Trading-Rule Whitelisted address is in the *to* side of the transaction.
- rulebypasser account is in the *from* or *to* side of the transaction.

Additionally, in the case of the ERC20, this rule doesn't apply also when registered treasury address is in the *to* side of the transaction.

### Revert Message

The rule processor reverts with the following error if the rule check fails: 

```
error TxnInFreezeWindow();
```

The selector for this error is `0xa7fb7b4b`.

## Create Function

Adding an account-purchase-controller rule is done through the function:

```c
function addPurchaseRule(
        address _appManagerAddr,
        bytes32[] calldata _accountTypes,
        uint256[] calldata _purchaseAmounts,
        uint16[] calldata _purchasePeriods,
        uint64 _startTime
    ) external ruleAdministratorOnly(_appManagerAddr) returns (uint32);
```
###### *see [TaggedRuleDataFacet](../../../src/protocol/economic/ruleProcessor/TaggedRuleDataFacet.sol)* 

The create function will return the protocol ID of the rule.

### Parameters:

- **_appManagerAddr** (address): The address of the application manager to verify that the caller has Rule administrator privileges.
- **_accountTypes** (bytes32[]): Array of applicable general tags.
- **_purchaseAmounts** (uint192[]): Array of purchase amounts corresponding to each tag.
- **_purchasePeriod** (uint16[]): Array of purchase periods corresponding to each tag. 
- **_startTime** (uint64): Array of Unix timestamps for the *_purchasePeriod* to start counting that applies to each tag.


### Parameter Optionality:
none

### Parameter Validation:

The following validation will be carried out by the create function in order to ensure that these parameters are valid and make sense:

- All input array lengths must be equal and not empty.
- `_appManagerAddr` Must not be the zero address.
- `_accountTypes` No blank tags.
- `_purchaseAmounts` 0 not allowed.
- `_purchasePeriod` 0 not allowed.
- `_startTime` 0 not allowed. Must be a valid timestamp no more than 1 year into the future.
