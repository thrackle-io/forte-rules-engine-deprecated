# Purpose

The purpose of the pricing contracts is to serve as the token-price data sources for ecosystem applications. The token pricers can be found in 2 different categories:

- [ERC20 pricers](./ERC20-PRICING.md).
- [ERC721 pricers](./ERC721-PRICING.md).

Some protocol rules require these contracts to be set in the tokens for them to be able to work.
