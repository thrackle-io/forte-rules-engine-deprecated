# `foundry-base` layer is where we build our own foundry container to use as a base image for
# anything that needs to use forge/anvil/cast/etc. This uses thrackle-io/foundry to install
# numbered versions of foundry's tools, using a modified `foundryup` and a foundry.lock file.
# The Foundry tools are installed as precompiled binaries providing a fast build time.
#
# This layer is cached and not re-built unless there is a change to foundry.lock.
